# How to Enable Ping (ICMP) on Windows VM

By default, Windows Server blocks ICMP (ping). To allow ping:

1. RDP into **VM2**.
2. Open **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security**.
3. Go to **Inbound Rules**.
4. Find rule: **File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)**.
5. Right-click â†’ **Enable Rule**.


or 

since this is a beginner friendly lab (not recommended)
1) go to settings
2) turn off windows firewall for both VMs
   
 Now VM2 will respond to ping requests from VM1.
