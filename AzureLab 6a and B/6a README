### Lab 6a -Deploying a Network Watcher

### In this lab, I tried to enable a network watcher to monitor the VMs connected via VNet-Peering
ðŸŽ¯ Goal

### Create two VNets with different IP address ranges.

### Deploy one VM in each VNet.

### Configure VNet Peering so the VMs can talk privately.

### Test connectivity using ping and RDP.

### Steps
Step 1: Create VNet1
- Name: VNet1
- Address space: 10.1.0.0/16
- Subnet: Subnet1 â†’ 10.1.1.0/24
- Deploy VM1 into VNet1 â†’ Subnet1.

Step 2: Create VNet2
- Name: VNet2
- Address space: 10.2.0.0/16
- Subnet: Subnet2 -> 10.2.1.0/24
- Deploy VM2 into VNet2 -> Subnet2.

Step 3: Configure VNet Peering
- From VNet1 -> Peerings -> + Add:
- Name: VNet1toVNet2
- Remote VNet: VNet2
- Allow virtual network access:  Enabled
- From VNet2 -> Peerings -> + Add:
- Name: VNet2toVNet1
- Remote VNet: VNet1
- Allow virtual network access: Enabled


step3: In Network Watcher -> Connection Monitor -> + Create
- Name: VM1-to-VM2-Test
- Region: Same as your VMs
- Source Type: Virtual Machine
- Source VM: VM1
- Destination Type: Virtual Machine
- Destination VM: VM2
- Protocol: TCP
- Port: 3389 (for RDP)
- Click Add Test Group -> Review + Create -> Create

Step 4: when you check the connection monitor you can see on the dashboard the pass cases, failed cases, etc.


The above connection keeps checking if Vm1 is able to connect to Vm2 via port 3389(RDP)

### Success Criteria

Successful cases shown as 1: which means the VM1 was successfully able to connect to VM2
